# Reverse Native Libraries

## Overview

This guide provides steps to reverse native libraries in an Android APK. The primary tool used is `apktool`, which helps in decompiling the APK file. Additionally, you can search for specific functions within the decompiled code.

## Steps

1. **Decompile the APK:**

   Use `apktool` to decompile the APK file. Replace `APKFILE` with the path to your APK file.
   ```sh
   apktool d APKFILE
    ```

2. **Search for Functions:**

- You can search for specific functions using the following pattern:

`JAVA_PACKAGENAME_CLASSNAME_FUNCTIONNAME`

   - JAVA_PACKAGENAME: The package name of the Java class.
   - CLASSNAME: The name of the class.
   - FUNCTIONNAME: The name of the function.
- This will help in identifying and analyzing the desired function in the decompiled code.

## Additional Information
- For more detailed information on using apktool and other reverse engineering tools, please refer to the official apktool documentation [https://apktool.org/docs/the-basics/intro/].
