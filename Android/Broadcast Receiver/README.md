# Broadcast Receiver 

## Static Broadcast Receiver

- [ ] Verify the presence of the `<receiver>` tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.


## Dynamic Broadcast Receiver

### Overview:
Dynamic broadcast receivers are similar to static broadcast receivers but are only active while the application is running.

- [ ] Verify the presence of the `registerReceiver()` function in the Java code.

## Testing Procedure

- Begin testing from the `onReceive()` function to ensure the broadcast receiver correctly handles the received intents.
