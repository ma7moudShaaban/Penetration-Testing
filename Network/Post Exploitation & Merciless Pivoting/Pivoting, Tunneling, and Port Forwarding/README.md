## Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling
### SSH Local Port Forwarding
```bash
# Local port forwarding
ssh -L LOCAL_PORT:SERVER:PORT HOST@TARGET_IP
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

# Forwarding multiple ports
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

# Confirming Port Forward with Netstat
netstat -antp
```
- The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server. 

### Dynamic port forwarding with SSH over SOCKS 
- SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that.
- We do this by starting a SOCKS listener on our local host (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network after connecting to the target host.

- Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host.

- To inform proxychains that we must use specific port, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`.
![SSH Tunneling over SOCKS Proxy](/images/SSH%20tunneling%20over%20socks%20proxy.png)

```bash
# Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH
ssh -D 9050 -C -N -f ubuntu@10.129.202.64

# -C — compress all data;
# -N — do not execute remote command or shell;
# -f — run in background.

# We add socks4 127.0.0.1 9050 to the last line of /etc/proxychains.conf file
sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf
socks4 127.0.0.1 9050

# Using Nmap with Proxychains
proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

# We can also use other tools with proxychains
proxychains msfconsole
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123

```

> [!NOTE]
> This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called SOCKS tunneling.


> [!WARNING]
> One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a full TCP connect scan over proxychains.
