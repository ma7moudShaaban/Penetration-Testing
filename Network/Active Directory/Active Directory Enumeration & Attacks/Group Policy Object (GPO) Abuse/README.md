# Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse
- GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

    - Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
    - Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
    - Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

- We can also use [group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r), [ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon), [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/), among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.

```powershell
# Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO |select displayname

displayname
-----------
Default Domain Policy
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Deny Control Panel Access
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Disable Forced Restarts
Block Removable Media
Disable Guest Account
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disable NetBIOS
AutoLogon
GuardAutoLogon
Certificate Services
```

- This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). We can see that autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, and see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain.

```powershell
# Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

DisplayName
-----------

Default Domain Policy
Disable NetBIOS
Disable Guest Account
AutoLogon

Disconnect Idle RDP
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Block Removable Media

Disable Forced Restarts
Deny Control Panel Access

# Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights
PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

ObjectDN              : CN={7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID             :

                        WriteOwner

AuditFlags            : None
```
- Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as WriteProperty and WriteDacl, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to.

```powershell
# Converting GPO GUID to Name
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532

```

- Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the Domain Users group has several rights over the Disconnect Idle RDP GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

- If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to Affected Objects on the Node Info tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

![GPOAffected](/images/gpoaffected.jpg)

- We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar.

> [!WARNING]
> When using a tool like this, we need to be careful because commands can be run that affect every computer within the OU that the GPO is linked to. If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts.
