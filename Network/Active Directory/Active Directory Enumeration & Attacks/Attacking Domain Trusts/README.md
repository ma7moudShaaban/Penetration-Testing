## Overview
- A trust is used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain (intra-domain) authentication, which allows users to access resources in (or perform administrative tasks) another domain, outside of the main domain where their account resides. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains and may allow either one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication. An organization can create various types of trusts:
    1. Parent-child: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain corp.inlanefreight.local could authenticate into the parent domain inlanefreight.local, and vice-versa.
    2. Cross-link: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
    3. External: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
    4. Tree-root: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
    5. Forest: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
    6. ESAE: A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.

- Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

    1. A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if Domain A has a trust with Domain B, and Domain B has a transitive trust with Domain C, then Domain A will automatically trust Domain C.
    2. In a non-transitive trust, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.


- Trusts can be set up in two directions: one-way or two-way (bidirectional).

- PowerView can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest) and the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). This information is beneficial once a foothold is obtained, and we plan to compromise the environment further.

```powershell

- Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is netdom. The netdom query sub-command of the netdom command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.

```bat
# Using netdom to query domain trust
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
Direction Trusted\Trusting domain                         Trust type

The command completed successfully.

# Using netdom to query domain controllers

The command completed successfully.

# Using netdom to query workstations and servers
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
List of workstations with accounts in the domain:

MAINLON      ( Workstation or Server )
CISERVER      ( Workstation or Server )

```
- We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the Map Domain Trusts pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.

## Attacking Child -> Parent Trusts 
### Windows
- SID History Primer
    - The sidHistory attribute is used in migration scenarios. 
    - If a user in one domain is migrated to another domain, a new account is created in the second domain. The original user's SID will be added to the new user's SID history attribute, ensuring that the user can still access resources in the original domain.

    - SID history is intended to work across domains, but can work in the same domain. 
    - Using Mimikatz, an attacker can perform SID history injection and add an administrator account to the SID History attribute of an account they control. When logging in with this account, all of the SIDs associated with the account are added to the user's token.
    - This token is used to determine what resources the account can access. 
    - If the SID of a Domain Admin account is added to the SID History attribute of this account, then this account will be able to perform DCSync and create a Golden Ticket or a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT).

#### ExtraSids Attack - Mimikatz
- This attack allows for the compromise of a parent domain once the child domain has been compromised.
- Therefore, if a user in a child domain that has their sidHistory set to the Enterprise Admins group (which only exists in the parent domain), they are treated as a member of this group, which allows for administrative access to the entire forest. 
- In other words, we are creating a Golden Ticket from the compromised child domain to compromise the parent domain. 
- In this case, we will leverage the SIDHistory to grant an account (or non-existent account) Enterprise Admin rights by modifying this attribute to contain the SID for the Enterprise Admins group, which will give us full access to the parent domain without actually being part of the group.


- To perform this attack after compromising a child domain, we need the following:

    - The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
    - The SID for the child domain
    - The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
    - The FQDN of the child domain.
    - The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain.
    - With this data collected, the attack can be performed with Mimikatz.


- This is also known as the Golden Ticket attack and is a well-known persistence mechanism for attackers in Active Directory environments.
- Since we have compromised the child domain, we can log in as a Domain Admin or similar and perform the DCSync attack to obtain the NT hash for the KRBTGT account.
```powershell

# Also, we can use powerview to Get-DomainSID
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainSID

S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689

```

- We can use Get-DomainGroup from PowerView to obtain the SID for the Enterprise Admins group in the parent domain.
- We could also do this with the Get-ADGroup cmdlet with a command such as `Get-ADGroup -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Server "INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL"`.

```powershell
# Obtaining Enterprise Admins Group's SID using Get-DomainGroup
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroup -Domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Identity "Enterprise Admins" | select distinguishedname,objectsid

distinguishedname                                       objectsid                                    
-----------------                                       ---------

```

- At this point, we have gathered the following data points:

    - The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
    - The SID for the child domain: S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689
    - The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist to create our Golden Ticket!): We'll choose a fake user: hacker
    - The FQDN of the child domain: LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    - The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519

- Before the attack, we can confirm no access to the file system of the DC in the parent domain.

- We can use lookupsid.py from the Impacket toolkit to perform SID brute forcing to find the SID of the child domain. 
- In this command, whatever we specify for the IP address (the IP of the domain controller in the child domain) will become the target domain for a SID lookup.

- The tool will give us back the SID for the domain and the RIDs for each user and group that could be used to create their SID in the format DOMAIN_SID-RID. For example, from the output below, we can see that the SID of the lab_adm user would be `S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689-1001`.

## Attacking Cross-Forest Trust Abuse
### Windows

- **Cross-Forest Kerberoasting**
    - Kerberos attacks such as Kerberoasting and ASREPRoasting can be performed across trusts, depending on the trust direction.
    - In a situation where you are positioned in a domain with either an inbound or bidirectional domain/forest trust, you can likely perform various attacks to gain a foothold.

```powershell

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From time to time, we'll run into a situation where there is a bidirectional forest trust managed by admins from the same company. If we can take over Domain A and obtain cleartext passwords or NT hashes for either the built-in Administrator account (or an account that is part of the Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins group in Domain A), and Domain B has a highly privileged account with the same name, then it is worth checking for password reuse across the two forests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We may also see users or admins from Domain A as members of a group in Domain B. Only Domain Local Groups allow security principals from outside its forest. We may see a Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin from Domain A as a member of the built-in Administrators group in Domain B in a bidirectional forest trust relationship. If we can take over this admin user in Domain A, we would gain full administrative access to Domain B based on group membership.


- We can use the PowerView function `Get-DomainForeignGroupMember` to enumerate groups with users that do not belong to the domain, also known as (foreign group membership).

```

- **SID History Abuse**
    - SID History can also be abused across a forest trust.
    - If a user is migrated from one forest to another and SID Filtering is not enabled, it becomes possible to add a SID from the other forest, and this SID will be added to the user's token when authenticating across the trust.
    - If the SID of an account with administrative privileges in Forest A is added to the SID history attribute of an account in Forest B, assuming they can authenticate across the forest, then this account will have administrative privileges when accessing resources in the partner forest.

> Suppose we can Kerberoast across a trust and have run out of options in the current domain. In that case, it could also be worth attempting a single password spray with the cracked password, as there is a possibility that it could be used for other service accounts if the same admins are in charge of both domains. Here, we have yet another example of iterative testing and leaving no stone unturned.

- We may, from time to time, see users or admins from one domain as members of a group in another domain.
- Since only Domain Local Groups allow users from outside their forest, it is not uncommon to see a highly privileged user from Domain A as a member of the built-in administrators group in domain B when dealing with a bidirectional forest trust relationship.

```bash
# Running bloodhound-python Against INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
bloodhound-python -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -dc ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -c All -u forend -p Klmcargo2

INFO: Found AD domain: inlanefreight.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01
INFO: Found 1 domains
INFO: Found 2 domains in the forest
INFO: Found 559 computers

# Compressing the File with zip -r
zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json

# Running bloodhound-python Against FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
bloodhound-python -d FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -dc ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -c All -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2

```

- After uploading the second set of data (either each JSON file or as one zip file), we can click on Users with Foreign Domain Group Membership under the Analysis tab and select the source domain as INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. 
- Here, we will see the built-in Administrator account for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is a member of the built-in Administrators group in the FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL domain as we saw previously.
