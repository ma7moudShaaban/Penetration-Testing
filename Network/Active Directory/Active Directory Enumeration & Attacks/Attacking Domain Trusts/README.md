# Attacking Domain Trusts
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Enumerating Trust Relationships](#enumerating-trust-relationships)


## Overview
- A trust is used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain (intra-domain) authentication, which allows users to access resources in (or perform administrative tasks) another domain, outside of the main domain where their account resides. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains and may allow either one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication. An organization can create various types of trusts:
    1. Parent-child: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain corp.inlanefreight.local could authenticate into the parent domain inlanefreight.local, and vice-versa.
    2. Cross-link: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
    3. External: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
    4. Tree-root: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
    5. Forest: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
    6. ESAE: A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.

- Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

    1. A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if Domain A has a trust with Domain B, and Domain B has a transitive trust with Domain C, then Domain A will automatically trust Domain C.
    2. In a non-transitive trust, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.


- Trusts can be set up in two directions: one-way or two-way (bidirectional).

- PowerView can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest) and the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). This information is beneficial once a foothold is obtained, and we plan to compromise the environment further.

```powershell
# Using Get-DomainTrustMapping

- Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is netdom. The netdom query sub-command of the netdom command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.

```bat
# Using netdom to query domain trust
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
Direction Trusted\Trusting domain                         Trust type
========= =======================                         ==========

<->       LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

<->       FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

The command completed successfully.

# Using netdom to query domain controllers
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
List of domain controllers with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-DC01
The command completed successfully.

# Using netdom to query workstations and servers
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
List of workstations with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-MS01
ACADEMY-EA-MX01      ( Workstation or Server )

SQL01      ( Workstation or Server )
ILF-XRG      ( Workstation or Server )
MAINLON      ( Workstation or Server )
CISERVER      ( Workstation or Server )
INDEX-DEV-LON      ( Workstation or Server )
...SNIP...

```
- We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the Map Domain Trusts pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.
