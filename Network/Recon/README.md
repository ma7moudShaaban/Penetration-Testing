# Reconnaissance 

. During the Reconnaissance phase, the attacker gathers information from public sources to learn about  the target : 
    - People and culture
    - Terminology
    - Technical infrastructure 

- Metadata: Most document formats include a significant amount of metadata (that is, data about data).This metadata is often associated with how the document is formatted for display but some of the metadata goes further, providing highly useful tidbits for the penetration tester to gather in the reconnaissance phase
 
. Information sometimes included in metadata:
-  Usernames
- File system paths
- E-mail addresses
- Client-side software in use (Office suite, PDF-generating tool,
- operating system type, and such)
- Other information not displayed on the screen from within the application associated with the document ("undo" data, previous revisions, hidden or obscured fields, and more)

Tools for Analyzing  Document Metadata :
- ExifTool
- FOCA


Another useful tools you should consider reading about are:

- google dorks
- OSINT
- DNS lookup
