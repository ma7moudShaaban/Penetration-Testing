# Access control and privilege Escalation

## Vertical Privilege Escalation
- If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. For example, if a non-administrative user can gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation.

## Horizontal Privilege Escalation
- Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type.
