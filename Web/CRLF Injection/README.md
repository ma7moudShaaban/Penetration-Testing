# CRLF Injection
- [Overview](#overview)


## Overview
- The carriage return character CR (\r), ASCII character 13 or `0x0D` in hex and `%0D` in URL-encoding, moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. The line feed character LF (\n), ASCII character 10 or `0x0A` in hex and `%0A` in URL-encoding, moves the cursor down to the next line.
- Together they form the CRLF control sequence which denotes the beginning of a new line.
