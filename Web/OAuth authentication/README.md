## OAuth Scopes
- The client application has to specify which data it wants to access and what kind of operations it wants to perform. It does this using the `scope` parameter of the authorization request it sends to the OAuth service.

## OAuth grant types
- We'll focus on the "authorization code" and "implicit" grant types as these are by far the most common

### Authorization code grant type
