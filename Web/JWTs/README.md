## Overview
- A JWT can either utilize JSON Web Signature (JWS) or JSON Web Encryption (JWE) for protection of the data contained within the JWT
- Two additional standards comprise JWTs. These are JSON Web Key (JWK) and JSON Web Algorithm (JWA). While JWK defines a JSON data structure for cryptographic keys, JWA defines cryptographic algorithms for JWTs.
## Attacks on JWTs
## Attacking Signature Verification
- **Missing Signature Verification**
    - We can simply manipulate that parameter in the payload, and jwt.io will automatically re-encode the JWT on the left side. This will invalidate the JWT's signature.

    - Before accepting a JWT, the web application must verify the JWT's signature to ensure it has not been tampered with. If the web application is misconfigured to accept JWTs without verifying their signature, we can manipulate our JWT to escalate privileges.

- **None Algorithm Attack**
    - To forge a JWT with the none algorithm, we must set the alg-claim in the JWT's header to none. We can achieve this using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.io/) by selecting the JWT Sign operation and setting the Signing algorithm to None.

## Attacking the Signing Secret

> [!NOTE] JWT supports three symmetric algorithms based on potentially guessable secrets: HS256, HS384, and HS512.

- **Cracking the Secret**
    - We will use hashcat to brute-force the JWT's secret. Hashcat's mode 16500 is for JWTs. To brute-force the secret. Save the JWT to a file: `echo -n eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiaHRiLXN0ZG50IiwiaXNBZG1pbiI6ZmFsc2UsImV4cCI6MTcxMTIwNDYzN30.r_rYB0tvuiA2scNQrmzBaMAG2rkGdMu9cGMEEl3WTW0 > jwt.txt`

    # To show the secret
    hashcat -m 16500 jwt.txt /SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt --show
    ```
    - Now that we have successfully brute-forced the JWT's signing secret, we can forge valid JWTs. After manipulating the JWT's body, we can paste the signing secret into jwt.io. The site will then compute a valid signature for our manipulated JWT.


## Algorithm Confusion
- Algorithm confusion is a JWT attack that forces the web application to use a different algorithm to verify the JWT's signature than the one used to create it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This attack only works if the web application uses the algorithm specified in the alg-claim of the JWT to determine the algorithm for signature verification

- While this public key is often provided by the web application, there are cases where we cannot obtain it directly. However, since the key is not meant to be kept private, it can be computed from the JWTs themselves.

- To achieve this, we will use [rsa_sign2n](https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n). The tool comes with a docker container we can use to compute the public key used to sign the JWTs.

```bash
# We can build the docker container like so:
git clone https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n

cd rsa_sign2n/standalone/

docker build . -t sig2n

# Now we can run the docker container:
docker run -it sig2n /bin/bash
```
- We must provide the tool with two different JWTs signed with the same public key to run it. We can obtain multiple JWTs by sending the login request multiple times in Burp Repeater. Afterward, we can run the script in the docker container with the captured JWTs:
```bash

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tool may compute multiple public key candidates. To reduce the number of candidates, we can rerun it with different JWTs captured from the web application.

- Additionally, the tool automatically creates symmetric JWTs signed with the computed public key in different formats. We can use these JWTs to test for an algorithm confusion vulnerability.
- Furthermore, if we send this token to the web application, it is accepted. Thus proving that the web application is vulnerable to algorithm confusion.

- **Forging a Token**
    1. rsa_sign2n conveniently saves the public key to a file within the docker container:
    ```bash
    cat b1969268f0e66b1c_65537_x509.pem

    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

    VQIDAQAB
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    ```
    2. We can use CyberChef to forge our JWT by selecting the JWT Sign operation. We must set the Signing algorithm to HS256 and paste the public key into the Private/Secret key field. Additionally, we need to add a newline (\n) at the end of the public key:

## Reusing JWT Secrets
- Context: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for authentication in web applications.

- Best Practice: Each web application should have a unique JWT signing secret.

- Risk: If multiple applications share the same secret, a token from one app can potentially be used on another (token reuse).

- **üõë Why It‚Äôs a Problem**
    - Cross-application access: A token valid on App A may also be accepted by App B if both use the same secret.

    - Privilege escalation: If the reused token contains elevated privileges, this could bypass role-based access controls in another application.

- **üîç Example Scenario**
    - A company operates two apps:

        - socialA.htb (user is a moderator)

        - socialB.htb (user is a regular user)

    - JWT from socialA.htb contains:
        - {"role": "moderator"}

    - JWT from socialB.htb contains:
        - {"role": "user"}

    - Issue: If both apps use the same secret, the user can:

        - Take the moderator token from socialA and present it to socialB then gain unauthorized moderator access on socialB
